Problem
A palindromic prime number is a positive integer that is both a prime number (meaning it has exactly two divisors: 
1
1 and itself) and a palindrome in base 
10
10 (meaning it reads the same both backwards and forwards).
Leading zeros are not considered when determining if a number is a palindrome (so 
20
20 is not a palindrome, even though it can be written as 
020
020).

You are given an integer 
�
N.
Consider the first 
�
N palindromic prime numbers. How many of them have an even number of digits, and how many of them have an odd number of digits?

My Code--
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>

#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>
using namespace __gnu_pbds;
int main()

{
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(0);
	int tccc= 1;
	cin >> tccc;

    while(tccc--){
		int n;
	   cin>>n;
      
	  if(n>4){
		 cout<<1<<" "<<n-1<<endl;
	  }
				else{
					cout<<0<<" "<<n<<endl;
				}
	}

    return 0;
    
    
    }
