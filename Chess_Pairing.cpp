Problem
You are hosting a chess tournament with 
2
�
2N people. Exactly 
�
X of them are rated players, and the remaining 
2
�
−
�
2N−X are unrated players.

Your job is to distribute the players into 
�
N pairs, where every player plays against the person paired up with them.

Since you want the rated players to have an advantage, you want to pair them with unrated players. Thus, you want to minimize the number of rated players whose opponent is also rated.
Print the minimum number of rated players whose opponents are also rated, among all possible pairings.

My Code---
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--){
	    int n,x;
	    cin>>n>>x;
	    if(x-n>0)
	   cout<<2*(x-n)<<endl;
	   else cout<<0<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
